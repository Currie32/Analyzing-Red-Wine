# Analyzing-Red-Wine
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis using R to determine which inputs have the greatest affect on the quality of wine; part of my Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity

Files:
Analyzing-Red-Wine.Rmd - Is an R markdown file that contains my analysis.
Analyzing-Red-Wine.html.zip - Is a zipped html file (the full file is larger than 25 mb, 
                              so it had to be zipped for it to be posted on GitHub).
wineQualityReds.csv - All the data, which was provided by Udacity.

Note: If you want to play around with either the .Rmd or .html files, change the path for the 'wine' variable to load the data.
